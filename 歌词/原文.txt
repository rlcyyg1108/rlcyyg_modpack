Andy Cizek、Josh Rezz - The Kill
唱：Andy Cizek
词: Jared Leto
曲: Jared Leto
What if I wanted to break?
Laugh it all off in your face
What would you do?
What if I fell to the floor?
Couldn't take this anymore
What would you do do do?
Come break me down
Bury me bury me
I am finished with you
What if I wanted to fight?
Beg for the rest of my life
What would you do?
You say you wanted more
What are you waiting for?
I'm not running from you
Come break me down
Bury me bury me
I am finished with you
Look in my eyes
You're killing me killing me
All I wanted was you
I tried to be someone else
But nothing seemed to change
I know now this is who I really am inside
Finally found myself
Fighting for a chance
I know now this is who I really am
Come break me down
Bury me bury me
I am finished with you you you
Look in my eyes
You're killing me killing me
All I wanted was you
Come break me down
Break me down
Break me down
What if I wanted to break?
Bury me bury me
What if I
Bury me bury me

Burning Down Alaska - Brighter Days
词：Burning Down Alaska
曲：Burning Down Alaska
How could I forget
The dreams we had
And the promises we made to ourselves
Memories of brighter days
Remembrance of another way
Forgotten for ages, lost in time
No cross to mark the place they lie
Take it back
Take it back
To how it used to be
Take it back
Take it back
The life that was always yours
And never give it away
The years go by
And we still wonder if there's
More to this
More to this
Now we wave Goodbye
And there was always something
More to this
More to this
They say that time runs like sand
And so does your life
Tossing and turning for the sake of nothing
Struggling to survive
How can we live on if it's always the same
When we are starved, motherf**kers and caught in routine
The colours fade away
Leaving nothing but the bitter taste of regret
Time's up, no chance to reset
Life ends and we all pay the debt
Take it back
Take it back
To how it used to be
Take it back
Take it back
The life that was always yours
And never give it away
The years go by
And we still wonder if there's
More to this
More to this
Now we wave Goodbye
And there was always something
More to this
More to this

Burning Down Alaska - Reality & Fiction
词：Burning Down Alaska
曲：Burning Down Alaska
My life's a Contradiction
Split into reality and fiction
My life's a product of indecision
Of fear that retains me like prison
The imperfection in me
I built my castle
I built my walls
To protect me from all the world holds
All I wanted to be was a brave man
But the choices I make
The path that I take
Have made me to who I am
It took so long to see
To understand what I've grown to be
There's so much more in me
My heart had good intentions
If they were the cause of my actions
If there was something
I could have done to hold me away from the coward I've become
The imperfection in me
I built my castle
I built my walls
To protect me from all the world holds
All I wanted to be was a brave man
But the choices I make
The path that I take
Have made me to who I am
There's so much more in me
So much more to set free
It took so long to see
To understand what I've grown to be
All I wanted to be was a brave man
But the choices I make
The path that I take
Have made me to who I am
It took so long to see
To understand what I've grown to be
There's so much more in me

Burning Down Alaska - Savior
词：Burning Down Alaska
曲：Burning Down Alaska
I never thought I'd be
As close to the edge as I am today
If there's no one to hold me back
I might be better off taking a step forward
But there's one thing I can't forget
The promise I made to never regret
To never look back
And to always be brave
But what if I'm the one who needs to be saved
What if there's no savior
What if there's no way to come back home
What if we wait forever
To find a way
We'll find a way
Over and over
Again and again
Will we be released
Will it ever end
Demanding our hero
We're crying for help
If time won't save us
Can we save ourselves
Searching for answers, a restless mind
A place that knows
Neither dark nor light
A truth I denied
Something left undone
The fear I swore I would overcome
We'll find a way
What if there's no savior
What if there's no way to come back home
What if we wait forever
To find a way
We'll find a way
Over and over
Again and again
Awaiting our savior without avail
Rely on your hero
I won't cry for help
Rather trade my life
For the trust in myself
If there's no one who can
Enlighten my pathway from now til the end
If there's no one to right me
To hold and to guide me
I'll raise my head
For I'm surviving
If there's no one who can
Enlighten my pathway from now til the end
If there's no one to right me
To hold and to guide me
I'll raise my head
For I'm surviving

Burning Down Alaska - Phantoms
词：Burning Down Alaska
曲：Burning Down Alaska
The night has always been
My dearest protection
From all that I've seen
My armor my shelter
To flee from the world or my friend say
Can you tell me
If there's some better way
Than trading the colors I loved
And the pain
For the black as a cure
But if I open my eyes
Can you promise me the darkness is gone and the light
Will return to our world return to my eyes
Too far to face the world
Too strayed from the path
My point of return
This silence
My prison
Fears blocking my vision
Time never changed
Our perception of pain
Our concept of misery
Counting the days
Since I turned my back on what I loved
But if I open my eyes
Can you promise me the darkness is gone and the light
Will return to our world return to my eyes
The echoes are calling my name
The shadows clinging to my face
Through the night through the night
Leaving the track
Giving up the fight
Through the night through the night
I lost myself I lost my pride
But at least I know that I am alive
Cause in the night we're all alone
Wandering around
In search of the unknown
Chase the sun
Clarify your vision
And reach beyond the night
Reach beyond the night
But if I open my eyes
Cause in the night we're all alone
Can you promise me the darkness is gone and the light
Wandering around
In search of the unknown
Will return to our world return to my eyes
Cause in the night we're all alone
Can you promise me the darkness is gone and the light
Wandering around
In search of the unknown
Will return to our world return to my eyes

Burning Down Alaska - Clockwork
词：Burning Down Alaska
曲：Burning Down Alaska
You know you've waited far too long
Another day already gone
Through all the times you stayed unhurt
So many lessons never learned
You never tasted any blood
How can you say you understood
What if a dream's price is your life
What if there's only tonight
Waiting and waiting
While time is taking
The best of me
The best of me
The best of me
The best of me
Come take your chance
Come take the key
A heart unlocked can set you free
From all the ties that hold you down
Believe me you are not alone
There's no time to stop the clocks
There's no time to stop the clocks
You never tasted any blood
How can you say you understood
What if a dream's price is your life
What if there's only tonight
Waiting and waiting
While time is taking
The best of me
The best of me
The best of me
The best of me
Waiting and waiting
While time is taking
The best of me
The best of me
Waiting and waiting
While time is taking
The best of me
The best of me
The best of me
The best of me
The best of me
The best of me

Burning Down Alaska - Monuments
词：Burning Down Alaska
曲：Burning Down Alaska
With nothing to live for
We aim for a life
Given the plot
To the stories we write
United in fate
And this anthem we sing
No sheep to a shepherd
We're pawns to a king
We claim to be something more
A masterpiece, an individual
Yet we fail, miserably
Stuck in a cage called life
We sit, we wait for more
And sing the anthem of our own demise
Our own demise
Now take the crown
This is our anthem
For the dreams we choose to live
This is our anthem
For a life, for a lifetime
Given the power to mend
Our lives to our heart's content
If life's a lesson
We fail to grasp
That our lives are monuments
Built to last
Always blaming someone else
For the flaw in the plan
Our own mistakes
Create or take your chance
Preserve your dignity
If you don't want your life
To be a constant misery
Our own demise
Now take the crown
This is our anthem
For the dreams we choose to live
This is our anthem
For a life, for a lifetime
With nothing to live for
We aim for a life
Given the plot
To the stories we write
United in fate
And this anthem we sing
No sheep to a shepherd
We're pawns to a king
