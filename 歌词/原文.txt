Andy Cizek、Josh Rezz - The Kill
唱：Andy Cizek
词: Jared Leto
曲: Jared Leto
What if I wanted to break?
Laugh it all off in your face
What would you do?
What if I fell to the floor?
Couldn't take this anymore
What would you do do do?
Come break me down
Bury me bury me
I am finished with you
What if I wanted to fight?
Beg for the rest of my life
What would you do?
You say you wanted more
What are you waiting for?
I'm not running from you
Come break me down
Bury me bury me
I am finished with you
Look in my eyes
You're killing me killing me
All I wanted was you
I tried to be someone else
But nothing seemed to change
I know now this is who I really am inside
Finally found myself
Fighting for a chance
I know now this is who I really am
Come break me down
Bury me bury me
I am finished with you you you
Look in my eyes
You're killing me killing me
All I wanted was you
Come break me down
Break me down
Break me down
What if I wanted to break?
Bury me bury me
What if I
Bury me bury me

Burning Down Alaska - Brighter Days
词：Burning Down Alaska
曲：Burning Down Alaska
How could I forget
The dreams we had
And the promises we made to ourselves
Memories of brighter days
Remembrance of another way
Forgotten for ages, lost in time
No cross to mark the place they lie
Take it back
Take it back
To how it used to be
Take it back
Take it back
The life that was always yours
And never give it away
The years go by
And we still wonder if there's
More to this
More to this
Now we wave Goodbye
And there was always something
More to this
More to this
They say that time runs like sand
And so does your life
Tossing and turning for the sake of nothing
Struggling to survive
How can we live on if it's always the same
When we are starved, motherf**kers and caught in routine
The colours fade away
Leaving nothing but the bitter taste of regret
Time's up, no chance to reset
Life ends and we all pay the debt
Take it back
Take it back
To how it used to be
Take it back
Take it back
The life that was always yours
And never give it away
The years go by
And we still wonder if there's
More to this
More to this
Now we wave Goodbye
And there was always something
More to this
More to this

Burning Down Alaska - Reality & Fiction
词：Burning Down Alaska
曲：Burning Down Alaska
My life's a Contradiction
Split into reality and fiction
My life's a product of indecision
Of fear that retains me like prison
The imperfection in me
I built my castle
I built my walls
To protect me from all the world holds
All I wanted to be was a brave man
But the choices I make
The path that I take
Have made me to who I am
It took so long to see
To understand what I've grown to be
There's so much more in me
My heart had good intentions
If they were the cause of my actions
If there was something
I could have done to hold me away from the coward I've become
The imperfection in me
I built my castle
I built my walls
To protect me from all the world holds
All I wanted to be was a brave man
But the choices I make
The path that I take
Have made me to who I am
There's so much more in me
So much more to set free
It took so long to see
To understand what I've grown to be
All I wanted to be was a brave man
But the choices I make
The path that I take
Have made me to who I am
It took so long to see
To understand what I've grown to be
There's so much more in me
