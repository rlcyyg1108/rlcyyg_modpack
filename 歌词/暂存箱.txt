The night has always been
My dearest protection
From all that I've seen
My armoura
My shelter
To flee from the world or my friend say
Can you tell me
If there's some better way
Than trading the colors I loved
And the pain
For the black as a cure
But if I open my eyes
Can you promise me the darkness is a gone and the light
Will return to our world return to my eyes
Too far to face the world
Too strayed form the path
My point of return
This silence
My prison
Fears blocking my vision
Time never changed
Our perfection of pain
Our concept of misery
Counting the days
Since I turned my back on what I loved
But if I open my eyes
Can you promise me the darkness is a gone and the light
Will return to our world return to my eyes
Instrumental
The echoes
Are calling my name
The shadows
Clinging to my face
Through the night
Through the night
Leaving the track
Giving up the fight
Through the night
Through the night
I lost myself I lost my pride
But at least I know that I am alive
Cause in the night we're all alone
Wandering around
In search of the unknown
Chase the sun
Clarify your vision
And reach beyond the night
Reach beyond the night
But if I open my eyes
Cause in the night we're all alone
Can you promise me the darkness is a gone and the light
(Wandering around)
Cause in the night we from be alone
Cause in the night we're all alone
(Can you promise me the darkness is a gone and the light)
Wandering around
Cause in the night we from be alone
(Can you promise me the darkness is a gone and the light)
